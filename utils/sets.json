The expansion symbol for Legends is the capital of a column.","common":75,"uncommon":114,"rare":121,"mythicRare":0,"basicLand":0,"total":310,"releasedAt":"1994-06-01","cardIds":[1470,1399,1437,1545,1398,1403,1404,1407,1410,1411,1420,1430,1435,1438,1441,1449,1462,1466,1467,1471,1473,1475,1478,1480,1488,1492,1493,1497,1499,1501,1503,1504,1506,1508,1512,1516,1517,1521,1522,1526,1531,1536,1537,1539,1540,1546,1548,1556,1558,1564,1569,1572,1575,1576,1579,1580,1581,1589,1593,1596,1603,1605,1610,1614,1615,1617,1619,1625,1633,1636,1641,1647,1649,1664,1665,1673,1675,1676,1677,1678,1683,1684,1688,1690,1691,1692,1693,1695,1701,1402,1418,1422,1423,1424,1432,1440,1447,1448,1450,1456,1465,1476,1485,1495,1518,1528,1530,1532,1544,1549,1555,1559,1560,1566,1571,1574,1578,1586,1592,1597,1600,1604,1627,1628,1630,1638,1652,1653,1654,1657,1661,1662,1666,1670,1674,1680,1687,1694,1696,1400,1401,1406,1409,1413,1415,1426,1442,1443,1446,1451,1452,1454,1455,1477,1483,1486,1502,1509,1510,1524,1534,1554,1557,1570,1588,1594,1595,1599,1612,1620,1622,1631,1637,1640,1643,1644,1650,1651,1660,1663,1667,1668,1669,1689,1697,1698,1699,1702,1704,1705,1706,1514,1577,1533,1562,1417,1419,1421,1427,1429,1433,1434,1436,1444,1457,1458,1463,1472,1474,1479,1482,1484,1487,1491,1494,1496,1498,1500,1527,1535,1538,1542,1550,1553,1561,1565,1567,1582,1583,1585,1590,1602,1607,1616,1618,1621,1623,1626,1629,1632,1634,1658,1659,1671,1672,1679,1681,1601,1613,1648,1412,1490,1611,1568,1425,1459,1405,1408,1414,1416,1428,1431,1445,1453,1460,1464,1468,1469,1481,1489,1505,1507,1511,1513,1515,1519,1520,1523,1525,1529,1541,1547,1551,1552,1563,1584,1587,1591,1598,1606,1609,1624,1635,1639,1642,1645,1655,1656,1682,1685,1686,1703,1707,1608,1543,1700,1573,1461,1439,1646]},{"id":"DRK","name":"The Dark","block":null,"type":"Expansion","description":"The Dark was the eighth Magic: The Gathering set and the fourth expansion to the game, released in August 1994.

It is the third and final set of the Mirrodin block. There are 165 cards overall, and like the rest of Mirrodin, an unusually large number of them are artifacts. However, Fifth Dawn adds a new twist to artifact theme of Mirrodin and Darksteel: it encourages using colored mana for playing artifact spells, via the Sunburst mechanic (see below). Fifth Dawn 's expansion symbol is a small image of Helm of Kaldra, a card from this set.\n  Fifth Dawn introduced an enhanced design for artifact cards, which uses a darker inner border to help players distinguish artifacts from white cards. Fifth Dawn theme decks contained a few reprints from Mirrodin and Darksteel with the improved card face.\n  The name Fifth Dawn is derived from the plane's five suns. Each sun is associated with a color of mana and the green sun, which has long been absent, returns to the sky as part of this set's storyline.","common":55,"uncommon":55,"rare":55,"mythicRare":0,"basicLand":0,"total":165,"releasedAt":"2004-06-04","cardIds":[50136,50144,50155,50188,50203,51110,51220,72722,72925,73556,50150,73565,39667,43529,43574,44608,46108,46159,46175,47438,47449,47800,48177,48215,50117,50119,50120,50129,50134,50137,50138,50139,50141,50145,50147,50156,50158,50159,50162,50163,50164,50171,50172,50176,50177,50179,50189,50190,50191,50192,50198,50201,50204,50207,50209,50210,50211,50212,50213,50834,50927,51075,51078,51080,51086,51088,51091,51092,51095,51097,51101,51102,51105,51113,51115,51119,51125,51129,51131,51132,51133,51135,51136,51138,51141,51146,51147,51148,51160,51161,51163,51166,51170,51177,51178,51180,51182,51183,51184,51185,51186,51189,51190,51221,51222,51223,51229,51230,51374,51375,51607,51610,51611,51612,51613,51617,51628,51629,51631,51633,51634,72681,72720,72721,72725,72727,72858,72860,72862,72921,72928,72999,73552,73553,73554,73555,73557,73558,73559,73561,73562,73564,73566,73567,73569,73570,73571,73572,73573,73574,73575,73578,73579,73582,73583,73587,73597,73598,73925,73926,73927,73928,73929,73932,76971]},{"id":"CHK","name":"Champions of Kamigawa","block":"Kamigawa","type":"Expansion","description":"Champions of Kamigawa (Champions or CHK) is the name of \n  the Magic: The Gathering expansion set released October 1, 2004.

The set is laden with references to previous Magic: the Gathering sets. The references are reflected in the card design, which incorporates special rules from older sets, and in the \"Timeshifted\" cards, which are cards reprinted from older sets using the older card design (abandoned three years previous with the 2003 release of Core Set 8th Edition.) The Time Spiral expansion symbol is an hourglass.\n  Time Spiral is the first set in the block of the same name. (A \"block\" consists of three theme-related expansion sets released over a period of a year.) It is followed by Planar Chaos, which deals with alternate timelines and includes many cards reprinted from previous sets but changed in some fundamental way, and Future Sight, which is forward-looking, both in that it includes cards from settings not yet explored in previous sets as well as including game mechanics that did not exist until it came out.\n  As with all Magic: the Gathering sets in this period, Time Spiral is accompanied by a tie-in novel of the same name. Time Spiral, written by Scott McGough, focuses on the efforts of Teferi to deal with the consequences of phasing out Shiv and Zhalfir during the Phyrexian Invasion.

Excluding the 13 'Conspiracy'-type cards which can be only used in Conspiracy-drafts, all of the new cards are legal in eternal format.","common":89,"uncommon":68,"rare":43,"mythicRare":10,"basicLand":0,"total":210,"releasedAt":"2014-06-06","cardIds":[382205,382215,382227,382231,382233,382207,382208,382209,382210,382211,382212,382214,382219,382221,382223,382225,382226,382228,382230,382232,382234,382235,382238,382239,382240,382242,382243,382244,382245,382246,382247,382248,382252,382254,382255,382256,382260,382261,382263,382264,382266,382267,382268,382269,382270,382271,382272,382275,382276,382277,382278,382280,382282,382284,382285,382287,382288,382290,382291,382293,382294,382295,382296,382297,382298,382299,382300,382302,382303,382304,382305,382306,382308,382309,382311,382314,382318,382319,382320,382321,382322,382323,382325,382326,382327,382328,382329,382330,382331,382333,382334,382335,382336,382337,382338,382339,382340,382341,382343,382344,382345,382346,382347,382348,382349,382350,382351,382352,382353,382354,382357,382358,382359,382362,382363,382364,382365,382366,382368,382369,382370,382371,382373,382374,382375,382376,382378,382379,382381,382383,382384,382386,382388,382390,382391,382392,382395,382396,382399,382402,382403,382405,382406,382407,382408,382409,382410,382413,382414,382213,382217,382218,382220,382224,382229,382236,382237,382241,382249,382250,382251,382257,382258,382259,382262,382265,382273,382274,382279,382281,382283,382286,382301,382307,382310,382312,382313,382316,382317,382324,382342,382361,382367,382372,382377,382380,382382,382385,382387,382389,382394,382397,382398,382400,382401,382404,382412,382411,382360,382289,382222,382216,382206,382332,382315,382253,382393,382356,382355,382292]},{"id":"M15","name":"Magic 2015 Core Set","block":null,"type":"Core","description":"Magic 2015 will be released on July 18, 2014. For the second time in Magic's history (the first being in Eighth Edition), a graphical redesign will be debuted. Changes include a slight font change (Starting with Magic 2015, an in-house font known as Beleren will be used rather than the slightly different off-the-shelf Matrix Bold font), the addition of a holofoil stamp in the bottom center of all rare and mythic rare cards, a slightly narrower black border, designer credit given on select cards (On the card 'Waste Not', design credit is given to the Magic community), and a redesign of the collector's info at the bottom of each card. The new border will make it easier for machines to read the cards, helping to prevent mispackaging.","common":101,"uncommon":80,"rare":53,"mythicRare":15,"basicLand":20,"total":269,"releasedAt":"2014-07-18","cardIds":[383207,383276,383345,383169,383173,383186,383188,383193,383196,383206,383217,383221,383271,383339,383354,383172,383174,383185,383190,383191,383201,383202,383203,383210,383212,383213,383216,383218,383245,383249,383260,383296,383161,383163,383164,383181,383199,383162,383195,383209,383279,383311,383313,383324,383332,383336,383337,383357,383360,383361,383364,383365,383366,383367,383368,383371,383390,383394,383406,383412,383413,383419,383420,383421,383426,383429,383431,383439,383441,383443,383340,383343,383344,383349,383352,383168,383175,383177,383178,383179,383189,383200,383205,383208,383232,383233,383248,383292,383326,383328,383335,383346,383348,383351,383353,383355,383359,383362,383363,383369,383377,383383,383392,383393,383395,383399,383400,383401,383402,383403,383404,383405,383408,383409,383410,383411,383415,383416,383417,383423,383427,383428,383430,383432,383187,383211,383280,383308,383309,383325,383373,383436,383437,383438,383440,383197,383237,383244,383247,383251,383258,383272,383285,383293,383305,383307,383310,383314,383375,383382,383385,383278,383302,383312,383323,383376,383378,383435,383166,383167,383180,383194,383214,383215,383227,383236,383252,383254,383262,383331,383334,383300,383350,383358,383391,383418,383261,383270,383299,383304,383318,383319,383372,383379,383386,383397,383433,383434,383442,383170,383171,383182,383183,383198,383204,383234,383243,383250,383266,383268,383269,383274,383288,383290,383291,383329,383330,383374,383381,383160,383165,383176,383184,383192,383222,383223,383224,383225,383229,383230,383231,383235,383239,383246,383253,383255,383256,383257,383259,383263,383267,383286,383287,383294,383295,383297,383301,383303,383320,383321,383322,383333,383341,383370,383384,383387,383422,383388,383389,383407,383414,383424,383425,383275,383277,383219,383220,383226,383228,383238,383240,383241,383242,383264,383265,383273,383281,383282,383283,383284,383289,383298,383306,383315,383316,383317,383327,383338,383342,383347,383356,383380,383396,383398]}]
